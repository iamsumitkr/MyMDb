#### Description: This is movie database for you that stores all the movies that you have watched and shares with you your friends watchlist too. You can give ratings and reviews also.

#### I have used Flask in this to make it interactive and used bootstrap to make the website look good, also I used sqlite3 for querying and storing the data in the database file. I also used jinja templates that comes with flask to make multiple webpages. I have uses session to keep the user data and keep him/her logged in. This app uses local storage instead of cookies which you can see in the flask code where I have configured that.

#### there are different templates that contain different webpages and their functionality can be known by its names and I took help of cs50's AI chatbot for solving some of the problems which I faced during the making of the project.
